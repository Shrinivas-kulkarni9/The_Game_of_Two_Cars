The project was to find a time optimal feedback law to solve the game of two cars. Our method, incorporating ML
to model the agents of the specific case of Pursuit Evasion games, was highly impactful, and the produced paths were near-optimal, which, when otherwise computed, need a computationally expensive numerical optimization.
Our model runs instantly on a personal computer, while the numerical optimization takes several minutes.
